An entity is represented by `<a-entity>`. It is the core building block that comprises everything within a scene.

A-Frame includes a number of entity types that extend on `<a-entity>`, including:

- `<a-box>`
- `<a-camera>`
- `<a-cylinder>`
- `<a-image>`
- `<a-light>`
- `<a-plane>`
- `<a-sky>`
- `<a-sphere>`
- And many more

Using a primitive you can easily, for example, create a box:

```html
<a-box color="red" depth="2" height="2" width="2"></a-box>
```

This will produce a red box:
